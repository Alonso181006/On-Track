# Welcome to On Track!

# Description:
- Habit trackers and productivity apps are often too rigid and do not accurately reflect how dynamic life can be, so we created On Track to solve this issue.
- On Track connects to your calendar to understand your schedule and plan your habits accordingly.
- Missed a Habit, don't worry, the app automatically schedules it to the next available time slots and gives you reminders to keep you On Track!
